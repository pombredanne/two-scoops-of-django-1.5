Before you submit an issue...
=============================

This is a repo for using GitHub's issue track to allow for the submitting of bugs, errors and corrections
to Two Scoops of Django. Please do not submit programming questions or problems, as there are many places
focused on answered Django questions.

One Item per Issue
------------------

In order for us to discuss issues, we ask that each individual item you find be placed in it's own issue.
A giant bulleted list makes it much harder for us to debate and fix problems.
